Homework 5



This assignment are to give you additional experience working with the jQuery UI and to pull together much of what we’ve been doing throughout the semester.
I created a scrabble board one line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
features fully working:

 * letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the proper distribution of the letters
 * letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares
 * program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square
 * score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers
 * the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played
 * after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand” back
to 7 tiles are selected
 * score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new game (implement next vs. restart)
 * Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them anywhere
else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.
 * Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can be moved back to the “rack”
 * user can always restart the game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
features partially working:

 * any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles.( It does not have function to delete all tiles.)
 * Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below
another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack” (the aleart will be appear, but the title can not bounce back to the "rack")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
features currently working:

 * Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below
another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack” (I am working to make the title bounce back to the rack if title is not valid).
 * Validating to see if a word that the user enters is valid (from /usr/share/dict/words)
